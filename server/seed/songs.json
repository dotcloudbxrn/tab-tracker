With lazy Rare Groove aesthetics, the project sees the well-travelled producer showcase his Detroit heritage to the fullest. Although Submorphics is an artist known throughout the Drum and Bass industry for his consistency in both style and quality, Detroit Haze cements his true musical coming of age. Having earned his stripes in the USA as both a producer and esteemed DJ, he now takes the spotlight as an authentic man of music. It's only logical that his momentum is captured on Lenzmanâ€™s The North Quarter, a record label which values real heart for music and craftsmanship above the so-called flavour of the month.\n"
